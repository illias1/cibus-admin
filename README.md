To do:

<!-- - public access to the order creation
  https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql-transformer/directives#public-authorization
  https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/pull/446
  https://github.com/dabit3/appsync-auth-and-unauth
  https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/graphql-security-appsync-amplify/ -->

<!-- * menu translations -->

- handle image upload and thumbnail creation

- solution against the pranks:
  - daily code
  - for waiters to signal that a table just became occupied and if an order comes without it - different signal
